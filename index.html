It's kind of like your weird Uncle Micky, who isn’t really your uncle but one of your dad’s friends from college. He looks ok enough on the surface, but something is not quite right. To solve this problem, ParkHub.com has evolved and created PRIME, the most functional, robust and dependable Parking Revenue Inventory Management Enterprise with real-time reporting. You should check this out. Seriously, don’t be like Uncle Micky, he smells weird.</p>

It measures the heart beat of your parking operation, recording and analyzing the rhythm of everything that happens inside your lots. It is modular and can be inserted in with your existing PARC system, or be amped up to allow you to see your lot from front to back. We understand that no two lots are the same. We know everyone dances to the beat of a different drum. It just so happens our drummer is a rockstar. Want to dance?</p>
